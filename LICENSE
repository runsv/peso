This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
The authors do not recognize the legitimacy of intellectual property.

The source code for this program and all associated documentation and
support files are released into the public domain.

Anyone is permitted, without limitation and free of charge, to
use, copy, reproduce, display, compile, execute, perform, modify,
adapt, merge, publish, translate, transmit, (re)distribute, and sell
copies of this software (consisting of the source code and all associated
documentation and support files) for any purpose and by any means.

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, the authors hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waive, abandon, and surrender all of
their Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as

Public License Fallback.

Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work

(i) in all territories worldwide,
(ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
     (including future time extensions),
(iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
      of copies, and
(iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort

limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
limitation may not apply to You.
